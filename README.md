## [World Domination](https://fukurou99.itch.io/world-domination)

You play the role of famous villains from vampires to eldritch horrors and try to dominate the world you are in.

This is a strategy game on a hex board. Unity's hex tiles helped a lot but their coordinate system was a little bit weird so we created our own coordinate system and a conversion system to go back and forth and be able to track all pieces on the board to make sure all moves were legal. There is also a fog of war mechanic that we update after every move.
